# TODO

# Thing to do before all
- Replace Sequelize by own model & migrations generator (using sqlite3 in dev & test, and pg in production)

## Can be great
- Controller method for automatic redirect to good view directory and good filename (using the method name to get the filename, and the controller name to get the file directory)
- On URL.json -> request json

# Vulnerabilities
- About snyk analyzing : check if new patchs
